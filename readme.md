## Welcome to my profile! 👋  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Last Update-April'2021-green" />

### Every day:
- 👨‍💻 I'm the CTO @ [Wanted](https://www.getwanted.com) 
- 💎 I’m currently working with `Reactjs` , `Python`, and `Swift`. From backend to frontend(s)... I can do my part :). Also some interesting growth-hacking methods that help our startup (~~top secret sorry~~) 
- 🐝 I love doing my bits with `Solidity` (especially for an ERC721 implementation) (I hear you hodlers!)
- 🤖 I want to expand my Certification in `Machine Learning` @ Stanford with more certifications/degrees and some hands-on disrupting project (ping me!)
- 📚 I enjoy writing technical books from time to time! See [Mastering iOS14](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M6DYXBQ) and [Swift Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LSWPJCW) 


### Before this:
- Worked with `Swift` + `ObjC` for 10 years (plus a couple with `Kotlin`).
- Created more than 20+ iOS apps for clients in SF and London. See some at my [website](http://marioeguiluz.com)
- Created my first startup back in the days and experienced the... **_learn, move quick, and iterate motto_**
- Reached #1 on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@mario_ea/made) a couple of times!
- Did well in a UK NHS Hackathon 🇬🇧 creating a Facebook Messenger [chatbot](https://github.com/marioeguiluz/Nima) to help with emergencies and Launch Hackathon at SF 🇺🇸.
